# autoCV

A clean CV template in LaTeX along with a GitHub action that complies the `*.tex` file and publishes a new PDF version when new changes are pushed to the repo

## Template Design

The template is designed to be clean with sections for
- Tabular sections for Work Experience, Education and Projects
- Support for including a list of publications read from a `*.bib` file
- Header with Font Awesome icons

## Usage
- Fork this repo (you can use the `Use this template` button)
- Modify the `cv.tex` file and push changes to your repo
- The complied PDF will be available under the `build` branch

Optionally, while forking this repo, if you choose to keep your copy public, the direct link to your CV will be: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo_name/build/cv.pdf"

You can use this link with Google Docs viewer in the follwing format and it will always point to an updated version of your CV like: "https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo_name/build/cv.pdf" [like this](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jitinnair1/autocv/build/cv.pdf)
